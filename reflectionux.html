                    <div class="about-me-text">
                        <p>Upon my initial introduction to the graphic and web design studio, I was brimming with
                            excitement to learn new things and eagerly anticipated the opportunity to innovate a
                            website. At the beginning of week one, I perused the blackboard syllabus and familiarised
                            myself with the basics of HTML/CSS. I took it upon myself to independently learn coding and
                            hoped that I would be able to adapt to the course content in the following weeks. Despite my
                            worries, I decided to manage my time effectively and allocated ample time towards learning
                            the course material and utilizing the resources provided on the blackboard.</p>
                        <p>In retrospect, Looking back, I realized that by completing my worksheets on time, I didn't
                            encounter any problems. This motivated me to enhance the skills I learned from workshops. To
                            achieve this, I started researching and studying on W3school (W3Schools, 2023). My goal was to create
                            something that is professionally made, as if it was intended for a client or consumers.</p>
                        <p>While wireframing, I aimed to incorporate a contemporary design and personalize it with my
                            own unique touch. I created multiple wireframe pages, some of which were themed. I explored
                            different methods of site navigation and ensured that all designs were compatible with
                            Flexbox, mobile devices, responsive screen sizes, and other cross-platforms.</p>
                        <p>In hindsight, I have noticed significant improvements in both my creative abilities and
                            technical skills in coding over the past few weeks. As part of a project involving posters
                            and typography systems, I used Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator, which helped me develop
                            my skills in using these creative software. I felt more confident and self-sufficient in
                            completing my posters and typography tasks.</p>
                        <p>While working on a project, I faced difficulties with designing posters and typography. I
                            needed assistance in understanding the concepts and decided to read the handbook of the
                            course non-design book by Robin Williams (Williams,R. 2008). This helped me to study the concepts of contrast,
                            repetition, alignment, and proximity, which in turn guided me with the C.R.A.P task. Once I
                            gained a good understanding of what to do for creating my poster, I searched for inspiration
                            and found a poster that caught my eye (Zazzle, 2023). I then created three versions of my poster using this
                            inspiration. I have themed my posters with California style and have further explained it in
                            my C.R.A.P task on each poster.</p>
                        <p>For my typography task, I conducted individual research online to explore the eight
                            typographic systems. During my research, I found a detailed blog post that explains how each
                            system works (Visualdesignfordh, 2014). After accumulating the knowledge, I began designing my own typographic
                            systems. To maintain consistency, I used black, white, and grey as my color palette. Though
                            it was my first time creating typographic systems, I enjoyed the process and spent many
                            hours perfecting my work. Gradually, I became more efficient with each system.</p>
                        <p>Coding the site was straightforward since I had already planned and wireframed most of its
                            functions and design elements. During the coding process, I received feedback from Gigi who
                            suggested using animated styles CSS (Eden, D. 2023). This helped me create flashy text for my headers and
                            images. I tried to incorporate everything I learned into the site and even did additional
                            work to enhance the user experience. I will include all the resources I used for the site in
                            my reference list for submission.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I enjoyed the process and was quite happy with the outcome. However, I can
                            improve with time by learning more new languages and improving my Javascript.</p>
