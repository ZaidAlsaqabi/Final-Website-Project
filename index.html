            <p>My name is <strong>Zaid Alsaqabi</strong> I am from Kuwait, where I was born and raised. A brief
                introduction:</p>
            <p>I am the youngest member of my family. While growing up, I am surrounded by siblings who had completed
                their bachelor's and master's degrees in the UK..</p>
            <p>Who also inspired me to pursue a career in the tech industry as I foresee it as the world's future. I
                have always wanted to be involved in the digital world by creating innovative projects or creating
                helpful things to solve problems people face. My interest in digital media started when I was an
                adolescent. Now that I have embarked on my journey at the university, I am looking to hone my skills and
                further develop new ones I gain during this course.</p>

I considered the contrast/repetition by using white and boldness as highlights. I used two typefaces and one font: ScriptoramaMarkdownJF, Grand Aventure Text, and Gloss And Bloom. Moreover, I kept elements to the minimum and used proximity to separate elements to not lose or distract the reader from the poster's purpose. Therefore, I did an adequate job encapsulating the rules and used alignment to ensure things lined up and tidy, also viewable from a distance.">

The contrast is good, and the repetition of elements is visible; however, it is different from what I initially wanted. I want to encapsulate the C.R.A.P rules and make the poster a California-style theme.">
